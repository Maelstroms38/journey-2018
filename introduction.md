# 2018 - Wrapped!

2018 is coming to a close, and this year was one of the best. Follow me on a journey around the world.

## On the Road

This year was one long road trip. Here are four places I visited:

- Tel Aviv, Israel 
- Zimbabwe, Africa 
- London, UK 
- Austin, Texas

Each of these cities offers a unique story. 

## Boston Sailing

I learned to sail in Boston harbor over the summer.

## Action, Adventure, Apps

As a mobile developer, learning on the road becomes second nature.

Let's get started.
