## Austin, Texas

Back in the states, there was one more city to visit: Austin. Dan and I were travelling to taste some southern comfort. There was plenty of food, music and nature. 

During the days we hiked by Enchanted Rock, the Green Belt and Barton Springs. For two city slickers, this was a chance to get away from New York's noise. We visited the Capital Building, and UT Austin's sprawling campus. 

Even in December it was warm enough to swim. In the evenings, we walked on South Congress Avenue. There was a strip of restaurants and bars. Santa was seen on horseback, presumably picking up tacos.

Austin is a vibrant city with a young populace. We joined the crowd for a concert at ACL: Live, Moody's Theater. Moody's Theater had been host to legendary performers, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash.

At the show, Moon Taxi opened with a banger. After their setlist, we nearly left, thinking the show was over! Shakey Graves played next, with his signature stage presence. During his set, Shakey Graves spoke of the love songs he wrote as a teenager.

Overall it was sweet to see the south without a tight schedule. Austin is easy to navigate by car, bike or scooter. If you happen to enjoy scooting around, you got options. The city is littered with scooters, which makes for a fun ride.

Next year, my plans are to see the west coast. Until then, safe travels and happy new year!
