## The Perfect Storm

Beginning in May, I started a five week sailing course. After signing up with Boston Sailing Center, the rest was a smooth ride. Or so I thought. The instructors would take groups of four out on Boston Harbor. They showed us how to raise sails, turn against the wind and dock the sailboat safely.

Sailing is a peaceful pastime. On a sailboat, the wind is your engine. Seeing Boston from water, I felt a comfortable distance from the city. From the harbor, it was my own Boston Tea Party. 

At every lesson, the conditions would worsen to test my sea legs. At first, a dull breeze would lightly caress the sails. The second lesson, a jostle of wind would poke around. The third, a mix of conditions would produce weather helm, and the boat began to keel over. The fourth was my navigation sail, and the final lesson.

It was a cloudy Tuesday afternoon. My instructor, Todd and I met at the harbor. I was going to navigate to Logan Airport at the edge of the harbor. The weather forecast foretold no trouble, we would ride the wind back. So we set sail.

During the ride out, Todd told me about his sailing experiences. Once we reached the airport, planes on their descents would buffet the sails from above. Starting to steer back, I saw a large, black cloud in the distance. The storm cloud loomed over Boston.

Todd tightened up the sails. I steered towards the harbor. As the storm cloud passed over us, the sunny sky plunged into darkness. I felt the wind rising against us, as it changed direction. Other sailors on a race course were heading back to the harbor. 

We were racing the sailors home. The rain began, and the wind was pushing us back. The storm was toying with us. The ship was rising and falling, but we steered onward. 

Reaching the harbor moorings, we quickly tied down the ship and dropped the sails. We made it. Todd was thrilled to be inside the sailing center again. Part of me wanted to return to the stormy sea.

Riding the storm was like an unofficial initiation. My sea legs were ready to voyage again. I brought a few friends out on the harbor and coasted through the summer. Until we meet again, storm cloud.

## My Achilles Heel

Unfortunately, my life at sea was short lived. In July, I suffered from an injury on my right achilles. My achilles tore during a basketball game in Central Park. I had to get surgery. Afterwards I spent two months in crutches and a boot. 

It was sweltering outside, and I was crutching around Cambridge. It felt shameful, to go from an active lifestyle to stuck on the couch. Physical therapy was the next step. Until then, I read Game of Thrones and tried to work on my portfolio. 

During this time, I fell into deep depression. It was the first time I ever considered a suicide. I ran a marathon and now could not even walk. There was no physical pain, but it seemed like I was out of the  race forever.

Looking back, I think this injury was meant to be. I always felt a source of pride in my physical gains, from working out and running. This injury was like sailing in a storm. There was no way out but through. 

The injury gave me a break from being active. No gym memberships and no race to train for. I was forced to stop sprinting through life. Part of me was still downcast, yet I had more time to read and write of my next adventure abroad. So I started writing.  

In writing, I created a different story about my injury. In this story, I would become a world traveler, and see the world with a boot on. One day I would walk and run again.

Special thanks to those who visited me during this time!
