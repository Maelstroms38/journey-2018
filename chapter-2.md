## Digital Migration

My family and I visited Africa for the first time in April. As someone who grew up in the city, seeing endless untouched nature was surreal. I was excited to go on safari. I was also excited to learn about African languages.

Prior to this trip, I was teaching a coding course in Tel Aviv. During the course, one of the students from Durban, South Africa shared an idea. He wanted to make online courses available in lesser-known languages. It is an idea that stuck with me to this day: To make online education more accessible, with translated content. 

After speaking with the Zimbabwe locals, I found out which languages were popular in Africa. To make this idea a reality, we would need translators for:

- Zulu
- Xhosa
- Swahili
- Arabic 

To make courses more accessible, we would want to provide internet access in these hub cities:

- Tunisia 
- Morocco
- Johannesburg
- Cape Town

With translated online courses, students can rise from lesser-known languages. This is a goal that inspires me, to reach a global audience. 

## Homo Deus

During this trip, another source of inspiration came from a book called "Homo Deus." The book dives into an age-old question: "What is the deal with modernity?"

The deal is as follows: Thoughts and feelings are sensations. Humans do not know where these sensations- consciousness-comes from. 

After I read this, I closed the book to let sensations arise. Then a new thought emerged: "What is that, over there?" Off in the distance, I saw a grassy field, with at least thirty football players. I let my curiosity take the reins, and wandered downhill to meet the players.

The players seemed surprised to find a tall, lanky guy headed towards the field. Someone passed a ball, I kicked it back. Pretty soon the game was finished, and they started towards home. One of the players introduced himself as "Trust," with a broad smile.

It was a warm welcome. Trust invited me to drink with the players in another town. I had to pass, yet he seemed to know this without me saying it. It would seem human nature is to adapt. 

To adapt is to pursue the idea of a better tomorrow. Even when the road ahead is unclear, one must move forward. This innate drive is a primal source of motivation. It guides one from the shadow of doubt.
