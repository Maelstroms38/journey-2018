## Teaching in Tel Aviv

This year went by fast. Beginning in Tel Aviv, I was teaching coding to college students. This was an exciting chance to share my web developer skills. Given a chance to teach developer skills to students from around the world, I was feeling confident.

Teaching can be a full-time endeavor, no matter how well you prepare. This fellowship was no different. My previous teaching experiences were positive. I found it challenging to keep the university students engaged. They were on a winter break, after all. Between sitting in a classroom and exploring Tel Aviv, there was no contest. Who could blame them?

## Coding Crash Course

To prepare for the course, I wrote a [syllabus](https://hackmd.io/-M13Orx5SVGrfoA9zW0U5g) about coding, no previous coding experience necessary. By the end of two weeks, my students launched their first web pages! 

Given the chance to teach this coding course, I found it difficult to translate some ideas from coding into English. In class, I tried to use storytelling and images (via slide decks) to keep a majority of students engaged. This may have been more impactful if my title was life coach, not coding instructor. 

The reality is that anyone who wants to learn coding can get started online for free. As a self-taught developer, this has always been my mindset. Being self-taught lets me see the potential in technology.

## Learning by Doing 

My attitude towards learning is a hands-on approach. This means learning by doing, with plenty of room for trial and error. Getting started with programming was a challenge. Most of my first-time app store submissions were rejected, and it was discouraging. 

Even after these failures, I was keen on building apps. I kept thinking of all the subway riders, with their eyes glued to their phones. With the right app, I could create a positive impact. So I continued making apps on the road.
