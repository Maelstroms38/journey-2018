## London

I visited the UK for the first time in August. It was my 25th birthday and my quarter-life crisis was in full swing. I had been injured over the summer, and could walk again with a boot. My motivation for this trip was to explore the UK's rich history.

There were markets, museums and plenty more to see. After landing in Stansted sirport, I boarded a train to King's Cross station. My friend Ben was studying at King's College, where I would stay on Tower Hill. 

Riding the London Underground was fast. I compared the tube with the New York City subway. The tube felt cleaner and had fewer homeless denizens. It was more intuitive to ride though I prefer the subway's flat rate fare. 

Arriving near Tower Hill, I used a cafe's WiFi to contact Ben. We met at his dorm where he gave me a SIM card for my stay. Then I embarked to London Tower. London Tower, an ancient fortress was host to several hundred executions. Ben said he never visited the place, even though it was at his doorstep.

After walking around the historic palace, I visited Covent Garden. Later that evening I met with a group for a pub crawl in Shoreditch. The pubs reminded me of New York's bowery. It was a fun night out, but my jet lag was finally catching up. I returned to Tower Hill to crash on Ben's couch.

The next day, I crossed London Bridge to see Borough Market. The market was dotted by merchants hawking fish, sausages, coffee, and other produce. Borough market was followed by Tate Modern museum, where the  works of Picasso were held on display. 

Seeing Picasso's paintings made me wonder if my apps would ever be portrayed in an art exhibit. I think most people do not consider apps as art, even if there are apps for art. 

My London visit lasted three days. Then I boarded a train to Edinburgh, Scotland.

## Edinburgh, Scotland

Edinburgh was in full swing for it's Fringe festival. Like going back to medieval times, the countryside gave way to a castle town. The road to Edinburgh Castle was lined with street performers, musicians and panhandlers. During the month-long festival, the town showcases free street performances. 

I met travelers at the Castle Rock hostel. Canadians, Germans, New Zealanders, Swedes and Australians were present. We shared stories and went our separate ways. I rose to see the castle the next morning.

Edinburgh Castle was host to the Black Dinner, inside the Great Hall. One of Game of Thrones's bloodiest scenes re-imagines this true event. Held within the castle is the "Stone of Destiny." During ordinations Scottish kings would sit on the shattered stone.  

In the streets below, one could imagine the world's fair had arrived in Edinburgh. Flyers for free shows were offered from all directions. There were simply too many performances to manage. Finally, one of the flyers included free tickets to a show starting soon. I wound up at a free comedy show by accident.

As luck would have it, the comedy show was hilarious. It helped to have a few drinks beforehand. After a few laughs, I rested before my next stop: Dublin, Ireland.

## Dublin, Ireland

Rising early, I took a direct flight to Dublin. Compared to the lively Fringe festival, Dublin was slow and gloomy. On the plus side, I met more travelers staying at the hostel.

On the first night, I went to Temple Bar with Theo, a young Frenchy, who moved to Dublin to improve his English. The second night I went out with two girls from Cologne, Lena and Luisa. Their English skills surpassed Theo's, with some gaffs. Luisa said her roommates would snore, but said they were snorkeling. 

This was one of the nuances of travel. Getting over a language barrier, even if you spoke the language.

The next day, I toured the Jameson distillery and Guinness storehouse. It was like Disneyland, but for alcoholics. I sipped a Guinness pint and listened to an Irish band playing, "House of the Rising Sun."

Most of this trip was fraught with uncertainty. Being a solo traveler has it's advantages, but it also forces one to adapt. Chance encounters with strangers can become positive experiences. Once loneliness fades, solo travel becomes an adventure.
